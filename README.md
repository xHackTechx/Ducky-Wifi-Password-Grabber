# Wifi-Password-Grabber
Wifi Password Grabber WINDOWS 10 and 11

Paying credit where credit is due, this script is from the HAK5 respository. I did however modify the code because I ran into a few errors running it. Timing was adjusted in a few places. The last two commands were modified as well. (STRINGLN was changed to STRING and the ENTER command was placed inbetween the last two commands due to errors) It is tested several times and works perfectly in both istances. 

For this one, all you have to do is copy the code and place it into your payload.dd file. Once you have done that you will need to:
* Insert your outlook email address on line 68 where indicated inbetween the single quotation marks
* Insert the password to your outlook mail on line 68 where indicated in the single quotationi marks
* Insert your outlook email address twice, once on line 72 and the other on line 74 inbetween the single quotation marks
* Save the file and reinsert your rubber ducky, pico pi or waveshare zero

The script takes around 25 seconds to complete. Once completed go to your email for the list of your passwords.

Have fun!!!!
